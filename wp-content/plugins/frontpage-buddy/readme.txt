## 🔌 Integrations 

FrontPage Buddy integrates seamlessly with popular WordPress plugins, giving users advanced profile customization options.
Currently it has integrations for the following plugins:

**1. BuddyPress & BuddyBoss Platform**

- **Member profiles:** BuddyPress/BuddyBoss member profiles have always been very impersonal. Member profile customization is practically non-existent. This plugin provides a front-page builder allowing your website's members to take control of their profile pages and add information about themselves. Your **members can customize their profile** by adding descriptions, embedding videos, embedding their social media profiles, etc. Check screenshots to see a preview.

- **Groups:** Create informative landing pages for buddypress/buddyboss groups. Allow group admins to customize the group's front page by adding details about the group, embedding videos, promoting related social media profiles, etc. Check screenshots to see a preview.

**2. bbPress**

This plugin allows your bbPress forum's  members to take control of their profile pages and add information about themselves. Your members can customize their profile pages by adding descriptions, embedding videos, embedding their social media profiles, etc.

**3. Ultimate Member**

This plugin allows your 'Ultimate Member' website's users to take control of their profile pages and add information about themselves. Your members can customize their profile pages by adding descriptions, embedding videos, embedding their social media profiles, etc.  

📣 *Integration with other, compatible plugins may be added in future.*

## ✏️ Widgets 

FrontPage Buddy provides customizable widgets (content blocks) to enhance profile and group pages.
These are completely **unrelated to standard WordPress widgets** and are called so for the lack of a better word. These represent the type of content that can be added to custom front pages.

**Use cases:**

- Add an 'About Me' section with rich text.
- Embed a YouTube introduction video on group landing pages.
- and many more...

Currently the 'widgets' this plugins provides are: 

- **Rich Text:** To add and format text. 
- **My Links:** To add links to your website & social profiles.. 
- **Youtube video embed:** To embed a youtube video player.
- **Social media profiles:** To embed a facebook page, an instagram profile or a twitter/X profile feed.

All the widgets are disabled by default. As an administrator you have complete control on which widgets you allow.
