Embed YouTube videos without slowing down your site. Easily embed one or multiple videos, shorts, and playlists.

== Description ==

The default embed block for YouTube videos sucks. It slows down your site. The more videos on the page the more it slow. This single-block plugin fixes that.

Why this block is better than the default one:

* Instead of loading the entire iframe, only the video thumbnail is loaded, resulting in significant performance improvements
* Ability to play multiple different videos as a custom playlist or input a playlist ID to play the whole playlist
* Ability to use a custom image as the video thumbnail
* Ability to set a custom aspect ratio value for displaying any kind of YouTube videos
* Ability to loop continuously once it finishes playing
* Ability to show related videos from the same channel as the initial video
* Automatically load the video title as the caption
* The same UI as the default core/embed, and you can use the video title as the caption of the block with one click
* It can be transformed from/to the core embed block.
* Automatically convert all default core embed YouTube blocks to this block with one line of code.

This plugin also provides a PHP API for developers to render a YouTube video URL as this block; or to automatically transform core/embed YouTube videos into this block.

The simplest example is:

        better_youtube_embed_block_render_block( ['url' => 'https://youtu.be/paSXmpHU9K4'] );

The example with all the parameters is:

        better_youtube_embed_block_render_block(
          [
            'url'               => 'https://youtu.be/paSXmpHU9K4',
            'aspectRatio'       => '16/9',
            'isMaxResThumbnail' => false,
            'thumbnailFormat'   => 'jpg',
            'caption'           => 'My awesome video',
            'caption_kses'      => false,
            'customThumbnail'   => 'https://example.com/bg.jpg',
            'settings'          => ['loop' => 1, 'rel' => 0],
            'echo'              => false,
          ]
        );

To automatically transform all core/embed YouTube videos on your site to this block, you need to put the following code to the wp-config.php file or your theme/plugin:

        define('BYEB_SPEED_UP_YOUTUBE_VIDEOS', true);

or

        add_filter( 'byeb_speed_up_youtube_videos', '__return_true' );

On iOS, browsers like Safari and Chrome require two clicks to play videos. If you want to allow users to play videos with a single click, you need to add the following code to the wp-config.php file or your theme/plugin:

        define('BYEB_FORCE_IFRAME_ON_UNSUPPORTED_BROWSERS', true);
